Hibernate, Maven, MySQL, Tomcat

In the initial project (admin panel for RPG) a map is used as a storage. The task is to rewrite this project and add a repository layer using Hibernate.

Steps:
* Fork the repository https://github.com/vasylmalik/project-hibernate-1
* Add necessary dependencies
* Run project on Tomcat
* Run the rpg schema creation script
* Add necessary annotations to the class com.game.entity.Player
* Implement methods: getAll, getAllCount, beforeStop, etc.
* Logging
